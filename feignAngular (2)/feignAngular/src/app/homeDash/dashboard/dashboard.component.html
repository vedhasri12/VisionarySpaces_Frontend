      <h1 style="color: black;"><b>What is a Land Survey Number?</b></h1>
      <p style="color: black; font-size: large;">
        Local governments or revenue officers issue a unique number to each portion of land in their city as a part of
        their record-keeping for tax purposes. The number serves as the land's identification and is known by the name
        of the land survey number. The use of land survey numbers is to gain access to property data such as the land
        shape, area, location, neighbourhood, and ownership rights.

        The data is assimilated by tax officials in each state after a comprehensive investigation of the land site, and
        then the government provides the land survey number. In Maharashtra, for instance, the land survey number is
        assigned by the Superintendent of Land Records and the Taluka Inspector of Land Records.</p><br>
      <h1 style="color: black;"><b>What is the Procedure for Obtaining the Land Survey Number?</b></h1>
      <p style="color: black; font-size: large;">
        The number of the land survey is stated on the sale deed. You may discover the land survey number by going to
        the official website of the state where the property is located. For example, the official website for the state
        of Andhra Pradesh is meebhoomi.ap.gov.in; for Haryana it is jamabandi.nic.in, and so forth. If this fails to
        work, you can go to the municipality's office and meet the authorities to get the information you need about the
        land survey number. Certain governments have created smartphone apps to make land information more accessible.
        For instance, in the state of Karnataka, the Dishank app may be used to collect land-related data.
      </p>
      <h1 style="color: black;"><b>What Method Can be Used for Verifying the Land Survey Number?</b></h1>
      <p style="color: black; font-size: large;">
        Cross-checking the land survey number on the sale deed with what's mentioned on the property tax bill is a good
        way to ensure. If there is a mistake, you must notify the local authorities and get it corrected.

        The revenue departments of the states are responsible for maintaining these websites. On these websites, one may
        quickly access data on the land survey number by following a simple procedure.

        If you want to acquire a property in India, you ought to know the land survey number to avoid legal
        complications.

        Due to its cheaper upkeep, better resale value, varied uses, and lower investment cost compared to built
        structures, the land is considered to be a popular investment option for Indian real estate purchasers.

        However, risk and reward are inextricably linked, and land is no exception. Because of the large numbers of
        fraudulent operations in this industry, it is crucial to grasp the importance of survey numbers.</p>
